# Option 4 Implementation Complete! 🎉

## What's Been Delivered

### Phase 3: AI Document Reading ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE - AI can now read and analyze all your attachments!

#### Supported Document Types:
- **📄 PDF files** - Extracts text from all pages (up to 50 pages max)
- **📝 Word documents (.docx)** - Extracts paragraphs and tables
